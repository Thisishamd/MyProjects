In today's competitive market, accurate sales forecasting is crucial for making informed business decisions. To address this, I created a machine learning model using Google Colab to predict sales, leveraging historical data to improve accuracy.

In this project, I developed a sales prediction model using a Random Forest Regressor, utilizing Pandas for data handling, Numpy for numerical operations, and StandardScaler from sklearn to normalize the feature set. The model aims to provide accurate sales forecasts by learning from past trends and adjusting for scale, ensuring reliable results.
